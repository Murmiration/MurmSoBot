# MurmSoBot
### Requires:
- Python 3.6
- [discord.py rewrite](https://github.com/rapptz/discord.py/tree/rewrite)
- lots of Python modules

[![Murm's Devserver](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/419544383835340824/widget.png?style=banner2)](https://discord.gg/pgnDz4A)

**Bot Invite**: None at the present moment, bot is in beta and I don't have alot of money for hosting.

Please keep in mind this is a passion project for me, but also a learning experience. I'm working hard to learn as I work on this, and I do take hiatuses on occasion.

Feel free to ask me questions or just say hi, just join the dev server and shoot me a DM!

The MySQL database scheme is included in `discord.sql`, you will have to reverse or replace the enviormental variables in the code for proper results.

Shoutout to NotSoSuper for the original code, and by extension, everyone that helped him as well.
